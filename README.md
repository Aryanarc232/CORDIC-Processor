# CORDIC-Processor
– It is used to implement CORDIC algorithm which is a highly iterative algorithm used for efficient calculation of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. – It employs simple shift and add operations to iteratively approximate rotations. – It is widely used in hardware implementations for efficient computation
